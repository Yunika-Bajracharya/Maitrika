###Team: Trynamic Trio

Name: Maitrika
Maternal and Child Health Services

Background:
We have around 51,000 Female Community Health Workers (FCHW) in Nepal (2020), who are local women contributing to Maternal and Child Health care and services. Majority of health problems in Nepal, particularly in the rural communities, are related to the health of women and children coupled with a lack of human resources in the health sector.

Problems faced:
For high risk situations, experts and doctors will be required but there is lack of doctors in rural and low resource areas of Nepal.
FCHW still use paper form to document their progress and patients’ records.

Our proposed solution:
Help connect FCHW to expert doctors, when in high risk situations or unique cases are found for which FCHW isn’t aware of.
Record data digitally insead of the paper format.
AI Generated Report that assists health workers to indicate high risk cases.
Easy to use UI / interface for Female Health Worker to use.
The service will be in Nepali language.
Medical data are sensitive data, so blockchain technology will be used for security
